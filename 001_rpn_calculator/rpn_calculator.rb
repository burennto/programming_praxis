# Exercise 1: RPN Calculator
# http://programmingpraxis.com/2009/02/19/rpn-calculator/
#
# Implement an RPN calculator that takes an expression like 19 2.14 + 4.5 2 4.3 / - *
# which is usually expressed as (19 + 2.14) * (4.5 - 2 / 4.3) and responds with 85.2974.
# The program should read expressions from standard input and print the top of the stack to
# standard output when a newline is encountered. The program should retain the state of the
# operand stack between expressions.
